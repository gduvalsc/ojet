Introduction
------------

Oracle JET is a great HTML application builder. The only flaw of this generator is the need to know both HTML and JAVASCRIPT!
This "ojet" package is a PYTHON3 wrapper around Oracle JET. Its aim is to hide as much as possible the complexity of the HTML and JACASCRIPT code.
Furthurmore "ojet" can be included in a jupyter notebook in order to add sophisticated HTML views or to help to test an "ojet" application.
